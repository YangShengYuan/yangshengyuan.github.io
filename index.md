# About Me

<img src="https://yangshengyuan.github.io/shengyuanyang.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Shengyuan Yang (杨声远)**.

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and a member of the [MadPL Group](https://madpl.cs.wisc.edu/). Along the way to the Ph.D. I recently earned an M.S., working under the supervision of Professor [Thomas Reps](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~reps/). This year, I start to expore research in programming quantum computing, under the supervision of [Charles Yuan](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~charlesyuan/). 

Before coming to Wisconsin, I obtained both a B.E. and an M.E. in Software Engineering from Nanjing University. As a member of the [PASCAL Research Group](https://pascal-lab.net/), I collaborated with Professors [Yue Li](https://yuelee.bitbucket.io/) and [Tian Tan](https://silverbullettt.bitbucket.io/) on foundational pointer analysis approaches for object-oriented languages.

For more information, please see my [résumé](https://yangshengyuan.github.io/file/CV-shengyuanyang.pdf).

## Projects

### Undergraduate Thesis at Nanjing University
- **Hymers**: a hybrid heap abstraction tool to accelerate pointer analysis by dividing abstract heaps into
different categories to apply corresponding abstraction methods.

### Master Thesis at Wisconsin-Madison
- **A Static Modeling of Java Streams**: a static modeling of Java streams in pointer analysis, modeling all kinds of stream pipeline operations to track stream input-output relations.

### Competition Projects
- **A Side-Scrolling Tactical RPG**: a game developed by Unity, lead an 8-person team to win 1st place in *Game Development Contest by Thunder Fire Studio, NetEase & Nanjing University*.
- **Campus Vacant Classroom Wayfinding App**: an Android App using WIFI detection to locate the user's position in buildings, and enabling in-building navigation for vacant classrooms, won 1st place in *hackathon by Academic Collaboration Dept., Microsoft Research Asia & Nanjing University*.

### Selcted Course Projects
- **OCEANIA**: a web system to visualize the call-graph of a given program uploaded by users. Led a 3-person team and impelemented 2 call-graph construction strategies (a fast code traversal solution and a precise pointer analysis solution). 
- **Online Cinema System**: a 2KLOC web system that releases, schedules, and sells tickets for cinema.
- **Online Judge System**: as the scrum manager, help a 4-person team to complete an agile software process in developing an online judge system in 2 sprints, using Zenhub, Kanban and burndown charts.
- **Test Impact Selction Tool**: leveraged static analysis framework WALA to design and implement a tool that selects test cases impacted by a given change.
