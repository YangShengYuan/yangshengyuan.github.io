# About Me

<img src="https://yangshengyuan.github.io/shengyuanyang.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Shengyuan Yang (杨声远)**.

I am a first year CS Ph.D. Student at University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interest lies in programming languages, especially in program analysis.

I received my B.E. as well as M.E. in Software Engineering from Nanjing University. I was a member of [PASCAL research group](https://pascal-lab.net/) at Nanjing University, where I worked with Professor [Yue Li](https://yuelee.bitbucket.io/) and [Tian Tan](https://silverbullettt.bitbucket.io/) and did research in pointer analysis.

## Projects

### Undergraduate Thesis
- **Hymers**: a hybrid heap abstraction tool to accelerate pointer analysis by dividing abstract heaps into
different categories to apply corresponding abstraction methods.

### Competition Projects
- **A Side-Scrolling Tactical RPG**: a game developed by Unity, lead an 8-person team to win 1st place in *Game Development Contest by Thunder Fire Studio, NetEase & Nanjing University*.
- **Campus Vacant Classroom Wayfinding App**: an Android App using WIFI detection to locate the user's position in buildings, and enabling in-building navigation for vacant classrooms, won 1st place in *hackathon by Academic Collaboration Dept., Microsoft Research Asia & Nanjing University*.

### Selcted Course Projects
- **OCEANIA**: a web system to visualize the call-graph of a given program uploaded by users. Led a 3-person team and impelemented 2 call-graph construction strategies (a fast code traversal solution and a precise pointer analysis solution). 
- **Online Cinema System**: a 2KLOC web system that releases, schedules, and sells tickets for cinema.
- **Online Judge System**: as the scrum manager, help a 4-person team to complete an agile software process in developing an online judge system in 2 sprints, using Zenhub, Kanban and burndown charts.
- **Test Impact Selction Tool**: leveraged static analysis framework WALA to design and implement a tool that selects test cases impacted by a given change.
